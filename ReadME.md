# ML Lab

This is one machine learning laboratory to explore all about the tecnologies while practicing and learning about the AI strategies.

## Basic Structure
The structure was segmented into src and tools, that strategy is to separe scratches, scripts ad tests of main projects and scripts.

Into ./src has projects, scripts, programs and another files that was applying the concepts and techniques learned or tested while practicing. These are examples to applications and implementations of machine learning features into a various contexts and scenarios.

Into ./tools are scratches, tests, features to make data files, jobs to clean and regularization data. Can be encountered too micro-APIs, installers, etc. for someone job that will be used to ./src files.
